# IP MAC Manager
## Summary
An open-source tool to backup local network adapter's IP address and change MAC address on Windows platform. It was tested only on Windows XP, 7 and may not work on modern Windows systems. The code uses several Windows API calls and registry modifications and may need elevated permission on Windows 7.

This project was originally written in C and Win32 API followed by a complete re-write in MFC. The feature remains same across both the versions, however later version uses OOP concepts leveraging C++ and MFC.

To my surprise this application is still available on [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Network-Tools/IP-Tools/IP-MAC-Manager.shtml) which was certainly taken from [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ip-mac-manager/).

## Archiving
It was originally written in 2010 and pushed to github for archieving purposes in mid 2017 from an old hard disk. In early 2024, it feels quite nostalgic to look back at this code while writing this readme file.
